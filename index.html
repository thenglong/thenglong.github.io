        <h3>Programming Language</h3>
        <p class="coding-description">I've been coding since the final year of my high school life, but unfortunately, I knew nothing at that time. I didnâ€™t even know that it is called coding. I just wanted to edit a moded video game that Iâ€™d been
          playing. It usually worked, and I felt very happy. I was excited. The time I was at college, I really enjoy it. For me, it is quite interesting to play programming trick with real-life mathematics, even though Iâ€™m not good at math at
          all.</p>

        <p class="gd-description">Some of you might think â€˜WOW! This guy is awesomeâ€™. Most of the programmers around the world donâ€™t like graphic design. Me niether. I just do it for living. I mean, I just do it to complete a requirement. So why I
          mention it here. Well, because it used to be my favourite one.</p>
